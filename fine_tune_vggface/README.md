# Fine-Tune VGG-Face weight
This is my experiment on VGG-Face weight to to see whether VGG-Face can classify faces that are not trained in its pre-trained model

The structure of the folder is same as other CNN classification where we have train, validation and test folders.

Three celebrities were selected and all of their images were downloaded from google. Their images also have been cropped using OpenCV before splitted into train, validation and test.
